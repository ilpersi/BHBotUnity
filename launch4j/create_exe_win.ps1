# This script is used to pack the BHBot executable together with its dependencies in one signe zip file.
# To make sure this works correctly you have to add to your PATH environment valiables the directories containing the following executables:
# - launch4jc.exe -> this is used to create the exe file from the jar one
# - jlink.exe -> This is used to create the modularized java run time environment that will be distributed together with software
#
# Before running this script, make sure to bypass execution policies:
# Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
